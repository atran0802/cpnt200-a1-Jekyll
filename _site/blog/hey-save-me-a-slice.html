<p>Hawaiian pizza is a pizza topped with tomato sauce, cheese, pineapple, and ham.</p>

<p>Greek-Canadian Sam Panopoulos claimed that he created the first Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1962. Inspired in part by his experience preparing Chinese dishes which commonly mix sweet and savoury flavours, Panopoulos experimented with adding pineapple, ham, bacon and other toppings which were not initially very popular.[1][2][3][4][5] The addition of pineapple to the traditional mix of tomato sauce and cheese, sometimes with ham or sometimes with bacon, soon became popular locally and eventually became a staple offering of pizzerias around the world.[6] Panopoulos chose the name Hawaiian after the brand of canned pineapple they used.[7]</p>

<p>In Germany, Hawaiian pizza is thought to be a variation of the ham, pineapple and cheese topped Toast Hawaii, originally introduced by Germanyâ€™s first TV cook Clemens Wilmenrod in 1955.[8][9][10]</p>
