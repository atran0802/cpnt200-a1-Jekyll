A calzone (UK: /kælˈtsoʊni, -neɪ/, US: /kælˈzoʊn, -zoʊneɪ, -ni/, Italian: [kalˈtsoːne]; "stocking" or "trouser")[1] is an Italian oven-baked folded pizza[2] that originated in Naples[3] in the 18th century.[4] A typical calzone is made from salted bread dough, baked in an oven and is stuffed with salami, ham or vegetables, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, as well as an egg.[3] Different regional variations in or on a calzone can often include other ingredients that are normally associated with pizza toppings. The term usually applies to an oven-baked turnover rather than a fried pastry (i.e. panzerotti),[5] though calzoni and panzerotti are often mistaken for each other.[5][6][7][8]

A calzone is somewhat similar to a stromboli. A calzone is a baked turnover stuffed with pizza ingredients. A stromboli is usually made by rolling up dough with cheese and meat ingredients and is then baked, but it does not generally contain pizza ingredients aside from cheese and Italian meats. Generally, strombolis do not usually contain tomato sauce, unlike calzones. A calzone is crescent-shaped, and a stromboli is usually shaped like a long cylinder. The distinction between the two is complicated because there is some variation in what constitutes a stromboli.[9][10][11]
