<p>A calzone (UK: /kÃ¦lËˆtsoÊŠni, -neÉª/, US: /kÃ¦lËˆzoÊŠn, -zoÊŠneÉª, -ni/, Italian: [kalËˆtsoËne]; â€œstockingâ€ or â€œtrouserâ€)[1] is an Italian oven-baked folded pizza[2] that originated in Naples[3] in the 18th century.[4] A typical calzone is made from salted bread dough, baked in an oven and is stuffed with salami, ham or vegetables, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, as well as an egg.[3] Different regional variations in or on a calzone can often include other ingredients that are normally associated with pizza toppings. The term usually applies to an oven-baked turnover rather than a fried pastry (i.e. panzerotti),[5] though calzoni and panzerotti are often mistaken for each other.[5][6][7][8]</p>
