<p>Neapolitan pizza (Italian: pizza napoletana) also known as Naples-style pizza, is a style of pizza made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. It must be made with either San Marzano tomatoes or Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a protected designation of origin cheese made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state and ‚ÄúFior di Latte di Agerola‚Äù, a cow milk mozzarella made exclusively in the Agerola comune.[1] Neapolitan pizza is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) product in Europe, and the art of its making is included on UNESCO‚Äôs list of intangible cultural heritage.[2] This style pizza gave rise to the New York-style pizza that was first made by Italian immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century.[3]</p>

<p>According to the rules proposed by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana,[4] the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of wheat flour (type 0 or 00, or a mixture of both), natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer‚Äôs yeast, salt and water. For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than 3 millimeters (0.12 in) thick. The pizza must be baked for 60‚Äì90 seconds in a 485 ¬∞C (905 ¬∞F) wood fire oven.[5] When cooked, it should be soft, elastic, tender and fragrant.</p>
