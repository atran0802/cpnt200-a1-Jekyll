<p>A chef is a trained professional cook and tradesman who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often focusing on a particular cuisine. The word ‚Äúchef‚Äù is derived from the term chef de cuisine (French pronunciation: ‚Äã[ É…õf.d…ô.k…•i.zin]), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive formal training from an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.</p>

<p>There are different terms that use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food preparation. Examples include a sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, a chef de partie, who handles a specific area of production. The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word ‚Äúchef‚Äù in their titles. Underneath the chefs are the kitchen assistants. A chef‚Äôs standard uniform includes a hat (called a toque), neckerchief, double-breasted jacket, apron and sturdy shoes (that may include steel or plastic toe-caps).</p>
